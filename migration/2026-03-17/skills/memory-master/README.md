- 📝 **Structured Memory**: "Cause → Change → Todo" format
- 🔄 **Auto Index Sync**: Write once, index updates automatically  
- ⚡ **Heuristic Recall**: Proactively finds relevant memories when context is missing
- 🧠 **Auto Learning**: When knowledge is insufficient, automatically search web to learn

## What Can It Do?

### 1. Auto-Write Memory

- No need to remind the AI - it writes automatically

### 2. Heuristic Recall
- When context is missing, proactively searches index to find relevant memories
- No need for user to say "remember" - AI finds it automatically

### 3. Auto Learning
- When knowledge is insufficient, automatically searches the web to learn
- Writes new knowledge to knowledge base for future use

### 4. Skill Auto-Record (Compatible with self-improving-agent)
- When skill completes: records what was learned
